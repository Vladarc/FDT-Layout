                <span>How To Choose the Correct Size Dog Collar for Your Dog</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Use a flexible tape measure or a string (which you measure with a rigid tape measure or ruler) to measure around your dog’s neck. Proper placement is high on the neck, just below the head.
                Add two inches to this length to allow for the buckle, snap and adjustment.
                Choose a collar and leash that has appropriately sized hardware for your dog. Light hardware for small or toy breeds, and increasingly heavier hardware for larger breeds or strong pullers.</p>
            <strong class="dog-collar-article__subtitle ">Fitting your Dog Collar</strong>
            <p>Collar should be placed high and snug on the neck, but still loose enough that you can fit 2-3 fingers easily between the collar and dogs neck.<br/>
                Too loose of a collar will allow dogs to slip out, or allow the collar to slide low on the neck, and allow the dog to more easily pull and make training more difficult.
                Check collar fit regularly on puppies and older dogs, as they grow or lose muscle.<br/>
                <strong>Remember! </strong>Puppies grow quickly, so it is extremely important to adjust the size of his collar as he gets bigger. Check the collar’s fit frequently during your dog’s first year of life and periodically after that. You should be able to slip two fingers comfortably underneath of the collar.</p>

                <span>Specialty Collars</span>
            </div>
            <p>Specialty collars are designed to help dog owners train their dogs, from puppy to adult. Training collars will allow you to gain control of your dog while he is on leash. These collars are particularly useful on dogs that are easily distracted, strong willed or can be hardly trained with traditional collars. Special dog collars were created to meet the demands of certain breeds who have unique requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Slip Collars are also known as Choke, or Choker, Collars. They have a shape of a simple ring and loop to constrict on a dog's neck. Usually made of chain, leather or nylon, slip collars and are an effective training tool for appropriate breeds, and are typically used for training dogs not to pull on lead, or to help dogs maintain focus on their handler. But you should know that slip collars should not be used on dogs that are inclinable a collapsed trachea, have upper respiratory disease or have pushed in snouts that cause breathing difficulties.</p>

            <p>Slip collars should not be used with dogs that have long slender necks like Greyhounds or Whippets. When using a choke chain, make sure the length is right or you won’t get the strong, quick pop. If the chain’s too long, when you go to give a correction, there’s too much slack. When it’s too short, the collar tightens too quickly. Professional dog trainers say that dog feels the correction more if you can keep the choke chain up high, right behind the ears. If so, the correction can have the greatest effect. Another advice they give is that the choke chain has to go on the right way. It needs to form a “P,” with the tail of the “P” on the same side as the handler. Choke chains should never be used for prolonged period of time. They should only be used for quick corrective actions, using a tug and release method. Choke collars should be used for training only.

            <p>Martingale Collars – they were developed for sighthounds initially and other dogs with narrow heads,
                which allows them to pull out of traditional dog collars. Martingale collars have limited ability to constrict when pulled, preventing dogs from pulling their heads out. Unlike slip collars, when sized and adjusted properly, martingales will not completely choke your dog. They are like flat collars but they tighten when the dog pulls. But despite they tighten, these accessories are generally not used for giving a correction the way a choke chain does. This kind of dog gear is used because it is less likely to slip over the dog’s head when adjusted correctly comparing with a flat collar. Martingale dog collars should be adjusted so that even at their tightest they cannot accidentally strangle the dog. It’s not recommended that a dog wear one of these while not supervised.</p>

                <strong>Prong Collars</strong> – are commonly applied for behaviour correction and obedience training. Looking like a medieval torture device, the prong or pinch collar should only be considered in the most extreme cases, when other methods have failed. These special training collars may be an effective and useful management device, when properly used, for controlling dogs that might be extremely active, difficult to control on a neck collar, or dog aggressive. These collars are also recognized as possibly useful for gaining control at the start of basic obedience training, essential education that dogs deserve and need. Also, with proper training, your dog can learn to walk on a leash using one of the recommended devices above. you can train your pet loose-leash walking and this is a rewarding way to help your dog overcome minor issues during a walk. Such training tools are not meant for daily walking. The pinch dog collar constricts around the neck, along with a set of blunt prongs that push into a dog’s neck when he/she pulls. Otherwise, they can cause pain and even injury if used in inappropriate way or with improper training methods. The pinch dog collar works fast reacting on sharp dog’s movements. It is well known as a successful dog training correction tool. When your pet is wearing a pinch collar, you don’t have to use as much physical strength to get an effective jerk as you do with a choke chain for example. Although this product looks quite severe, it may actually be safer in some respect than the choke chain. The sharp-looking parts only look dangerous but in fact, they are blunted and can’t pierce the skin. These pinches are spaced out so that the force is spread out across all of them. Overall, pinch collars produce less pressure on the neck when jerked hard compared to the choke chains because the surface area of the pinch collar is greater.

            <p>All specialty collars, whether they are choke, pinch or martingale, are absolutely safe for the canine if you use them according to the rules.</p>
            <strong class="dog-collar-article__subtitle ">Dog’s Identification</strong>
            <p>It is reasonable that your dog wear a collar with his identification. Collar tags/plates often play an important role in reuniting you with your dog if he ever gets lost. With the help of collar tags all your contact information, as well as your emergency backup contacts will become available. Please be advised, that we don't engrave any information on the plate. Any engraving can be done separately.</p>
