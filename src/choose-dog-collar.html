                Let's see what are the most common questions concerning choosing a proper collar:
            </h3>

        <div class="article__subtitle">1. How to determine a suitable collar width?</div>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>  The wider the collar the less pressure it puts on your dog's neck. <br/>
            <strong>Example:</strong>A 1 inch wide collar will be less comfortable for a dog in comparison with a 3 inch wide collar because all the pressure will be applied over a smaller surface area. You can purchase this Wide Leather Dog Collar with Spikes and Studs.<br/>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Please note that wider collars are also heavier and should not be purchased for dogs with short necks.<br/>
            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> If you are not sure which width to buy, please choose a standard 1 1/2 inch wide collar, which is the most popular average collar width for the majority of large and medium dog breeds. For example, this Gorgeous Decorated Leather Dog Collar for training and walking.<br/>
        </p>
        <div class="article__subtitle">2. How to determine an appropriate length of the collar?</div>
        <p>
            Easily Adjustable Nylon Dog Collar: If you have an adult dog, then you won’t have any troubles with it. Healthy fully grown dogs usually stay the same weight and size for most of their life, therefore when you purchase a collar for a fully grown dog the adjustments will be minimal and you will probably use only one hole to adjust the collar on his or her neck.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exceptions are the dogs with long or dense hair the length of which can change from time to time because of season grooming and hair cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            For such dogs you should: <br/>
            For minimum adjustment - measure the neck circumference right after a haircut. <br/>
            For maximum adjustment - measure the neck circumference when your dog has the longest hair.

        </p>
        <p>
            Another exception is overweight or underweight dogs. In these cases, if you are going to put your dog on a diet, you should take into account how it can affect your dog’s dimensions. Please take it into account when buying a collar to avoid a situation of wasting money on a collar that no longer fits your pet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tricky situation is acquiring a collar for a puppy. The best thing to do is to choose a low budget collar until your puppy is at least 10-12 month old. You can buy for your little friend this Easily Adjustable Nylon Dog Collar for affordable price.<br/>
           <strong>Example:</strong> For a 6 month old puppy with a neck size of 15 inches purchase a collar which will fit 15-19 inches.
        </p>
        <div class="article__image-wrapper">
            <img src="/img/article-photo.jpg" alt="" >
        </div>
        <p>
            The standard adjustment range is 4 inches (the distance between the smallest and largest adjustment hole of the collar). Four inches collar length will be great both for dogs with or without long hair.<br/>
            If you feel that you need a larger adjustment range, please contact us and we will be happy to help you in most cases. Sometimes an additional fee will be charged.<br/>
            Please note, that if you are going to use the collar on its smallest adjustment hole there will be an approximate 5-6 inches of extra collar length which you might want to cut off.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Warning:</strong> The biggest misconception is to measure your old dog collar and hope that based on this information you will purchase a good fitting one. This is wrong. What you need to do is to measure your dog’s neck circumference and choose the size of a new collar based on that. Measure it tightly, there is no need to add a finger or two because all of our collars are adjustable.<br/>
           <strong> Example:</strong> If you need to buy a collar for an adult German Shepherd with a neck size of 20 inches (your dog never gets haircuts) then choose a collar which will fit a 20 inch neck size. The collar you will receive will be a collar with an adjustment range between 18-22 inches. The first hole will be close to 18 inches and the last hole will be close to 22 inches. There will be 5 adjustment holes total.

        <div class="article__subtitle">The most important criteria while choosing a dog collar:</div>

        <p>
            <strong>Material</strong><br/>
            We present you a large amount of genuine leather, nylon and metal collars. The choice of material for a collar depends on your requirements.<br/>
            <strong>Nylon. </strong>Choose a nylon dog collar, if you want an easy-to-use all weather dog supply. It is suitable for walking under the rain, snow, swimming and for high humidity climate. These collars are rather strong, lightweight and low priced. Check a wide range of All Weather Nylon Dog Collars.<br/>
            <strong>Leather.</strong> Choose genuine leather, if you want a safe natural dog collar which looks even better with years. A leather collar can serve you for a life time. Just make sure to treat it occasionally with water repellent and leather conditioner. Leather does not like water but when you apply a water repellent, you will protect it from moisture. So, if you get accidentally caught up in the rain, you may not worry too much about its quality. Leather collars are also perfect for dogs with sensitive skin who tend to have different kinds of allergies when contacting with artificial material. You can choose a leather collar you like among Top Quality Leather Dog Collars for different kinds of activities.<br/>
            Metal. Choose a metal collar when you are looking for a special one which will help you to correct your dog’s behavior. There are stainless steel, brass and curogan dog collars. Stainless steel collars are highly rustproof, they can be also covered with chrome layer for better resistance to wet. Curogan collars are great if you want to avoid allergies and discoloration of a dog’s coat. Check Metal Dog Collars here.

        <p>
            <strong>Functionality </strong><br/>
            First, let's divide dog collars into 2 main groups: collars with the only function to allow the handler to attach a leash. any other collar which has an additional purpose – training, identification, behavior correction, etc.
        </p>
        <div class="article__image-wrapper">
            <img src="/img/article-photo.jpg" alt="" >
        </div>
        <p>Regarding the first group, if you follow our advice as far as for choosing an appropriate collar width and length, and assuming that you have already decided what material better meets your needs, it all comes down to your personal taste. Simply look at the images and get the collar you prefer more. If you enjoy several models, you can buy them all. Just contact us, and we will think over a bulk discount specially for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second group is a little bit more complicated but let’s figure it out together.
            Choose an extra strong collar with a handle if you are going to involve your dog in agitation or attack training, such as this Agitation Training Leather Dog Collar.
            Choose a martingale dog collar if you want to correct your dog’s behavior and be able to put the collar on and off fast. This 'Smart Control' Martingale Dog Collar is perfect for obedience training.<br/>
            Choose a pinch / prong collar if you want to have advanced control over your canine. Such a collar is also perfect for behavior correction just like a martingale one. This type of collar will probably suit best for the people with limited amount of strength and older dog handlers. There is a wide range of Rustproof Prong Dog Collars meant for dog training.<br/>
            Choose a choke chain collar or a choke chain fur saver (choke collar with bigger links) to train your dog. They have more gentle effect than prong collars and are perfect for long-haired dog breeds. For example, you can choose this Herm Sprenger Black Stainless Steel Fur Saver that will help you to keep your pet's fur in perfect conditions.<br/>
            Choose a show collar that is specially meant for dog shows, such as this Smooth Chrome Plated Dog Show Collar .
